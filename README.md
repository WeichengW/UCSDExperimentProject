# The Impact of Monetary Incentives on Willingness to Share Non-Sensitive Personal Information

## Overview
This project investigates how monetary incentives influence the willingness of UCSD students to share non-sensitive personal information. The study was conducted as an experiment on UCSD’s Library Walk, involving 200 students split into control and treatment groups. The objective was to determine if financial incentives could increase participation rates in data sharing without compromising privacy.

## Motivation
In today’s data-driven environment, encouraging voluntary data sharing is essential for organizations. However, ensuring ethical standards and participant willingness requires balancing incentives with privacy concerns. This project seeks to provide insights into how a small monetary incentive affects students' responses in a controlled setting, offering organizations potential strategies to improve data collection methods.

## Research Question
Does offering a monetary incentive increase UCSD students' willingness to share non-sensitive personal information compared to no incentive?

## Experiment Design
- **Participants**: 200 UCSD students, divided equally into control (no incentive) and treatment ($1 incentive per response) groups.
- **Procedure**: Participants filled out a 10-question survey, where each question answered was scored as 1, and unanswered as 0. Data collected included Year of Enrollment, Field of Study, Academic GPA, and other non-sensitive information.
- **Randomization**: Participants were encountered at random during two time slots on the same day to ensure unbiased selection.
- **Groups**:
  - **Control Group**: No incentive offered.
  - **Treatment Group**: Offered $1 per response.

## Results
### Control Group (No Incentive)
- **Average Fraction of Questions Answered**: 0.389
- **Variance**: 0.0404
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.201

### Treatment Group (With Incentive)
- **Average Fraction of Questions Answered**: 0.812
- **Variance**: 0.0314
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.177

The data indicates that monetary incentives positively impacted participants' willingness to share information.

## Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis testing was conducted to evaluate the statistical significance of the incentive's impact:
- **Null Hypothesis**: Monetary incentives do not affect the willingness to share personal information.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: Monetary incentives increase the willingness to share personal information.
- **t-Statistic**: 15.79
- **Critical Values**: 1.64 (5% significance level), 2.33 (1% significance level)
- **Conclusion**: With |t-stat| > critical values, we reject the null hypothesis at both 5% and 1% significance levels, confirming the positive effect of incentives on willingness to share information.

## Conclusion
The findings show that monetary incentives significantly increase UCSD students' willingness to share non-sensitive personal information. However, due to potential self-reporting biases and limited demographic diversity, further research across varied populations and incentive structures is recommended.
